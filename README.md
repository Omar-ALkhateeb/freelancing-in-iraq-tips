some personal tips and resources for beginner freelancers in Iraq

## General tips

### 1 - Never negotaite your prices
Your work speaks for itself, your prices should be consistant not unfair to you or your clients.
even if you have some rule based on your work hours or whatever this info should not be public beacuse:
 - it will never be good enough to the clients
 - some clients might use it againts you
 - it adds ZERO value to the work and serve you nothing but more explanations

### 2 - Personal or team site
self-explanatory. your site should have a clear definition of your:
 - Goals
 - past projects
 - all the teams CV's

### 3 - Write clear and loophole-free contracts
Loophole contracts must:
 - be clear
 - define all aspects or your project: prices, features, your chats with the clients too if possible
 - define how delays, bugs, errors should be managed
 
making contract templates is generally a good idea too and saves alot of time

## Personal tips

### 1 - how do you know if you're up for this project?
 - have you worked on a project with that scale before?
 - can you visualize how the main parts of the project would work?
 - can you find an existing project code that has the same functionality? and can you manage that project? 
if you answered more tahn 2 questions as true then yes
ps: if you could make a small prototype with all of the main functionality  then 100% yes

### 2 - setting project time
 - planning: first week for task management and planning (2 weeks if large)
 - estimated: your estimated time (divide the project into tasks and add extra 10% on each one)
 - debugging: extra 10% from your estimated time for testing and crushing bugs
